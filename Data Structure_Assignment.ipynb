    "#Question_N0.6: Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer: Python List\n",
    "# Python Lists are just like dynamic-sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous  always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of Python List\n",
    "# Here are five important applications of Python lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Data Storage and Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application: Python lists are used to store and manipulate collections of data, whether homogeneous (e.g., all integers) or heterogeneous (e.g., a mix of integers, strings, and other types).\n",
    "# Example: A list can store a series of sensor readings, user inputs, or any other sequential data that can be modified, updated, or analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Implementing Stacks and Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application: Lists are commonly used to implement stacks (LIFO: Last-In, First-Out) and queues (FIFO: First-In, First-Out) due to their ability to add and remove elements from the end or beginning.\n",
    "# Example: Using append() to push onto a stack and pop() to remove the top element.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Iteration and Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application: Lists are ideal for storing data that needs to be iterated over and processed, such as reading data from files, performing computations, or generating reports.\n",
    "# Example: Iterating through a list of numbers to calculate their sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Dynamic Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "# Application: Lists in Python are dynamic arrays, meaning they can grow and shrink in size. This is useful in applications where the size of the dataset isn’t known in advance and needs to be adjusted dynamically.\n",
    "# Example: Collecting user inputs or dynamically generating a list of results based on computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python Tuple\n",
    "# A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications of Python Tuple\n",
    "# Here are five important applications of Python tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Immutable Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be modified. This makes them ideal for storing data that should not change throughout the program, such as configuration settings, constants, or fixed data points.\n",
    "# Example: Storing the coordinates of a point (x, y) in a 2D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in a dictionary. This is not possible with lists, as they are mutable and hence unhashable.\n",
    "# Example: Using tuples to represent composite keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Storing Heterogeneous Data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Tuples can hold elements of different data types. This makes them useful for grouping together heterogeneous data that logically belongs together.\n",
    "# Example: Storing a person’s name, age, and email in a single tuple.\n"

    "#Here are the key reasons why immutability is required for dictionary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Hashing: Dictionaries in Python use a hash table for storage, which means that each key is processed through a hash function that generates an integer\n",
    "#(the hash value). This hash value is used to quickly locate the corresponding value in the dictionary. If a key were mutable and its contents changed, its\n",
    "#hash value would also change, leading to inconsistencies and making it impossible to find the value associated with that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Consistency: For a key to be reliably retrievable, it must remain constant. If keys could change, it would break the fundamental property of dictionaries,\n",
    "#which is that a given key should always return the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Performance: The performance of dictionaries relies on the efficiency of hashing. If keys were mutable, the dictionary would have to handle the complexities\n",
